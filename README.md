VirtualBox belongs to Oracle (https://www.virtualbox.org/)

## LICENSES & DISCLAIMER
This software uses the GPLv2 license, just like VirtualBox. Despite this, no VirtualBox files are included in this package.<br>
This software just allows easy interaction with VirtualBox's vboxmanage.exe so users don't need to get into Windows' CMD.


## VMIPCheck
### Make a shortcut to this file and add the next arguments:<br>
ARGUMENT 1: Folder where VBoxManage.exe is located __(address without the last "\")__<br>
ARGUMENT 2: Name of the Virtual Machine you want to check the IP address of<br>

## VMIconChange
UI-friendly applet that changes the icon of the VM you want instead of writing it on the terminal.<br>
You can change the icon once you locate vboxmanage, get your desired .png and choose your desired VM.
